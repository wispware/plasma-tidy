"""Tidy's look at itself. Part of what Tidy does reaches into Plasma and KWin where they have
no public interface, so a new version of either may change it. The widgets and the KWin
script tell what they find; a part that is not there any more is left alone by them (it is
switched off, nothing half works), and Tidy says so once, and in full with --check."""
